## Materials

The primary textbook of the course is 
*"Type-Driven development with Idris"* by Edwin Brady, 
available online via the library. Complementary material is 
[*"Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!"*](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) by Lipovaƒça, and 
*"The craft of functional programming"*, by Thompson.

 * **Exercises:** you can try to solve the 
   [99 Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)
   in Idris.
